// grade : q
// repetitionNumber : n | The repetition number n, which is the number of times the card has been successfully recalled (meaning it was given a grade â‰¥ 3) in a row since the last time it was not.
// easiness : EF | The easiness factor EF, which loosely indicates how "easy" the card is (more precisely, it determines how quickly the inter-repetition interval grows). The initial value of EF is 2.5.
// interval : I | The inter-repetition interval I, which is the length of time (in days) SuperMemo will wait after the previous review before asking the user to review the card again.
